Data QAQC:	
1)	Working with ‘first hits’ data that is mostly processed. Species names are corrected and grouped together appropriately
2)	Read in data
3)	Rename columns as R reads the numbers in and adds an X in front of them. Change to just the numbers 
4)	Change the data to the long format so that there is only one column with year information and one column with pin hits
5)	Filter out pin hit values that are NA or 0
6)	Create a unique ID for each plot as there is no unique identifying plot ID
a.	Do this by pasting the block and treatment together
7)	Create a recognizable date format using lubridate
a.	There is only year, month information – add 01 for the day for every observation
8)	Take out bare ground observations
9)	This data frame can now be used in stability, variance ratio, and evenness calculations or for calculating total pin hits (cover)
10)	Make a separate data frame with only treatment information by selecting each unique block, treatment, and unique ID


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
