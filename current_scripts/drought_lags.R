## New Drought Lag Attempts

## 1. partition dataset into drought and non-drought years

## 2. non-drought years: relate total cover to the cumulative rainfall over the preceding
      ## rainy season (previous 4 months)

## 3. calculate the degree to which total cover is lower in drought years and in years
      ## following drought than the expected given the antecedent rainfall based on the 
      ## rainfall-cover relationship in non-drought years

## 4. Drought effect in a year following drought year, divided by the drought effect in 
      ## the drought year would give a value b/w 0 and 1 that estimates the magnitude of
      ## the lag effect
